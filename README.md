# Project Scribe
Simple, reliable, distraction free writer to nudge you towards a better life story - by surfacing your receipts, one day at a time.

> [!TIP]  
> This is the base configuration of Scribe, to serve one straight forward, important use case: it turns the Scribe platform into a simple and reliable short message writer (simple by design). It works very well as is.
> 
> However, if you wish, you can go beyond this and make this human-machine/ human-computer interface truly your own.
>
> The hardware is capable, the design is easily adaptable, and the firmware is easy to develop/ scale in whichever direction your imagination leads you towards!
> I'm excited to see what you come up with!

Base Scribe: An open-source thermal printer system that helps you capture and inscribe the meaningful moments of your life, one day at a time. Project Scribe transforms your daily achievements or worthy notes into physical receipts - your receipts for the life you lead, to gently nudge you into better and bigger things.

It is highly hackable, adaptable and scalable to fit your needs and wants.

## Features of the "out-of-the-box" configuration (v1)
- Thermal Printing: Clean, permanent-enough tactile records - no mess, no dried ink
- Standard Rolls: Very cheap and available paper - e.g. couple of bucks for 6 rolls 
- Minimal Web Interface: Sleek, distraction-free input with just a text box and submit button (and some confetti for that extra delight)
- API Integration: Connect with Apple Shortcuts, automation tools, or other services
- Offline Operation: No cloud services required (but cloud capable) - everything works locally
- Organic Design: Loosely Inspired by Dalí and Gaudí, with flowing curves that hint at life's organic nature
- Low Power: Runs on a single USB port, no separate power supply needed (about 0.5W at idle)
- Open Source: Completely free, hackable, and customizable
