Scribe: a simple way to track todo lists and information with physical receipts.

## Todo:
 - [x] Move to platformio project
 - [x] Support for `Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3` and `Cashino CSN-A5` thermal printer
 - [ ] Implement markdown-style document formatting (Headers, etc.)
 - [ ] Improve workflow for mobile and desktop
 

## Features of the "out-of-the-box" configuration (v1)
- **Thermal Printing:** Clean, permanent-enough tactile records - no mess, no dried ink
- **Standard Rolls:** Very cheap and available paper - e.g. couple of bucks for 6 rolls 
- **Minimalist Web Interface:** Sleek, distraction-free input with just a text box and submit button (and some confetti for that extra delight)
- **API Integration:** Integrate Project Scribe with your favourite tools like Apple Shortcuts, IFTTT, or your own custom scripts.
- **Offline Operation:** No cloud services required (but cloud capable) - everything works locally
- **Organic Design:** Loosely Inspired by Dalí and Gaudí, with flowing curves that hint at life's organic nature
- **Low Power:** Runs on a single USB port, no separate power supply needed (about 0.5W at idle)
- **Open Source:** Completely free, hackable, and customisable

## BOM

- ESP32 C3 (any ESP/Arduino board will do, but you will have to adjust the code)
- CSN-A4L/CSN-A5 thermal printer (any serial thermal printer might do, although I haven't tested for that - you may need to adjust power and pinout)
- Paper rolls (printer comes preloaded with one, and it'll last ages - here, you're looking for 57.5±0.5mm width and 30mm max diameter)

- 3D printer for the body (you may need some glue to fix the parts together - no screws required)
- Wires (for soldering and connecting components + USB wire to power the whole thing)
- 5V/ USB power supply capable of higher currents (only used during thermal printing)

**Important Note (Thanks to the community for pointed this out!):** Do your own due diligence regarding thermal paper types - the thermal paper we handle everyday (e.g. through receipts from the grocery store, restaurants, takeaway, taxis, etc.) will contain BPA. When choosing your rolls for this, you should definitely go for BPA-free paper just to be on the safer side - the links provided are for BPA-free paper. If you can, go a step further and look for “phenol-free” paper. Three types that do not contain BPA or BPS and are competitively priced contain either ascorbic acid (vitamin C), urea-based Pergafast 201, or a technology without developers, Blue4est.

Note2: The components might be slightly different as listings always change silently - always check. If you notice any issues, please ping me to update the readme.

Note3: If you don't have a 3D printer but would like to build this, consider using the PCBWay affiliate link: https://pcbway.com/g/86cN6v (discount to you + some small help for the project).

Note4: Some thermal paper is treated against fading - can last e.g. 35+ years. If you're planning on using Scribe for archival purposes, consider ink fading when picking up the right rolls.

## Pin-out/ wiring during operation

The project uses SoftwareSerial to communicate with the printer, leaving the hardware serial pins free.

| Printer Pin | D1 mini Pin | Power Supply Pin | Description      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| TTL RX      | D3          | -                | D1 Mini Transmit |
| TTL TX      | D4          | -                | D1 Mini Receive  |
| TTL GND     | GND         | GND              | Common Ground    |
| Power VH    | -           | 5V               | Printer VIN      |
| Power GND   | GND         | GND              | Printer GND      |

**Note:** Never power the printer directly from/ through the D1 Mini! You'll burn your microcontroller.

**Note2:** Only power the D1 Mini via one source (either via USB during firmware flashing, or via the 5V pin during normal operation from the shared power supply)

**Note3:** You can remove the other wires (e.g. TTL NC/ DTR) - you'll deal with less clutter since these will not be used.

## Microcontroller firmware

One sketch file, using the IDE of your choice (e.g. the main Arduino IDE works well with the added modules for D1 mini + libraries - that's what I use). Make sure you update the firmware variables before flashing it to the MCU (e.g. wifi details and other preferences you might choose to tweak).

Please check everything is working before soldering and squeezing everything into the 3D printed shell.

**Note:** As mentioned above - do not power the printer through the D1 Mini and do not power the D1 mini via both the USB and its pins at the same time.

## Assembly

In each set, there are 2x 3D Printed components:
- The head unit (in which your MCU + Thermal Printer + wiring slot it)
- The neck/ leg (connects with the head and has a channel to elegantly route/ feed your power cable through)

**Printing considerations**
- The head has fillets, so you will most likely require supports
- Smaller line heights will produce better results
- The neck/ leg can be printed without any supports upright
- The components may vary in size slightly, so will the tolerances/ clearances - you may need to us glue to put the pieces together in case they're lose, or sandpaper in case they're too tight

**Assembly considerations**
- Make sure you route the wire through the neck/ leg of Scribe before you crimp the connectors
- Important: make sure each connection and wire is well isolated before you cram all the wiring into the head unit! You really don't want a short circuit
- Always to a test run before final assembly
- Do not glue the electrical components together, in case you need to service this later (you shouldn't need to glue them together)
## User guide for standard configuration (v1)

1. **Power On:** Connect the device to a beefy 5V USB power source. Wait a few moments for it to boot, connect to WiFi, and print its startup receipt.
2. **Get the IP Address:** The local IP address will be printed on the startup receipt.
3. **Start Scribing!**
4. **Look back at your story**
5. **Improve and scribe some more**

**Message format**
The as-is firmware prints messages in the right orientation for the roll of paper to naturally wind downwards, with word wrap. The first line is the header, reminiscent of a calendar - date on black background. The following lines are the message itself.

**Scribing through a web browser**
- The D1 Mini creates a local web server and the as-is configuration includes a minimalist, light web app
- Open a web browser on any device on the same network and navigate to `http://<IP_ADDRESS>`. Type your entry (up to 200 characters) and press Enter or click the "Send" button.
- This limitation is not the limitation of the printer/ hardware/ system, I just like it to keep the messages concise - you can change it in firmware (just like everything else around here)

**Scribing through the API**
- You can also send entries directly from a browser or script. For example: `http://<IP_ADDRESS>/submit?message=Went%20for%20a%20hike`
- This is particularly useful when running automations - it works straight out of the box
- Different to the web app, when using the API there is no character limit out of the box. In addition, you can also backdate your entries, by adding the `date` parameter: `http://<IP_ADDRESS>/submit?message=Finished%20the%20book&date=2025-07-04`

## Beyond the as-is: Ideas to Extend or Replace the As-Is Functionality

The combination of a WiFi-enabled MCU, a Thermal Printer and an API-ready web server makes Scribe a powerful platform for all sorts of creative projects.

You can easily adapt the existing code to create a completely new experience. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- **Daily Briefing Printer:** Modify the code to fetch data from public APIs every morning. It could print:
    - Your first few calendar events for the day.
    - The local weather forecast.
    - A curated news headline from an RSS feed.
    - The word or quote of the day.
- **Task & Issue Tracker:** Connect it to your productivity tools (like Todoist, Jira, or GitHub) via their APIs or webhooks.
    - Print new tasks or tickets as they are assigned to you.
    - Print your most important tasks for the day each morning.
- **Kitchen Companion:** Place it in your kitchen to print:
    - Shopping lists sent from a family messaging app or a shared note.
    - A recipe of the day.
    - Measurement conversion charts on demand.
- **Tiny Message Receiver:** Create a unique, private messaging system. Family members could send short messages to the printer from anywhere, creating a physical message board.
- **Daily Dose of Fun:** Make it a source of daily delight by having it print:
    - A random joke or comic strip (like XKCD).
    - A "shower thought" from a Reddit subreddit.
    - A custom fortune cookie message.
- **Photo Booth Printer:** Extend the functionality to accept an image URL via the API, dither the image in the firmware, and print low-resolution, stylised versions of your photos.

## Troubleshooting

In my testing and usage, I found this setup to be extremely reliable (after all, these printers are used in commercial settings). If the device is not printing as expected, this may be because of several reasons, e.g.:
- incorrect wiring/ a short
- paper not inserted correctly
- current on offer is not high enough
